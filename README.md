## ðŸ”¹ Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/internetkid2001/2025-profolio-website.git
cd 2025-profolio-website
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start development server:**

```bash
npm start
```

4. **Firebase Environment Variables:**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root folder:

```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Analytics Setup

Google Analytics is integrated using the global `gtag.js` snippet placed in `public/index.html`.

```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-6HB9S6L7P0"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-6HB9S6L7P0');
</script>
```

Page views are automatically tracked on route changes using a `useEffect` hook in `App.jsx` with React Router.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to Firebase Hosting whenever a change is pushed to the `main` branch, using GitHub Actions.

Deployment automation was configured using:

```bash
firebase init hosting:github
```

This setup:

* Creates a service account for GitHub Actions
* Stores it securely as a GitHub secret
* Writes CI workflows to `.github/workflows/`
* Runs `npm ci && npm run build` before each deploy
* Deploys to Firebase Hosting live channel on merge to `main`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements

* Add animations with Framer Motion
* Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility
* Add SEO meta tags and OpenGraph data for better sharing
* Track video interactions and form submissions via custom analytics events
